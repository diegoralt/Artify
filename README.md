# Artify

### Project setup instructions

* 

### Analysis and development process

* I reviewed the project requirements and quickly analyzed the Discogs API documentation.
* I made a list of requirements to detect functional, non-functional and non-scope requirements. This helps me understand the features of the app clearly.
* I reviewed similar features within the Discogs and Spotify app for more context about functionality in a productive app.
* I created a mockup of the project with the Claude app. I defined the requirements in the chat, also requested changes to the colors and some visual components.
* I looked for services to obtain information and show it in the app using the Claude app. I created an account on Discogs to get a token and made a some requests from the Postman app to check functionality and service responses.
* I created a project in Android Studio and setup git. Also, I made the initial commit within the project with an empty app and did a push for my Github account to register the project there.
